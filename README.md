## About me

> I am a passionate Software Developer with 2 years experience. I have a knack for problem-solving and a love for programming. When I am not writing code, I am often found playing Death Metal with my band or spending time with my family.
>
> I am currently embarking on a learning journey into the world of Cyber Security and Ethical Penetration testing. Gaining insight into how to exploit vulnerable applications and servers using industry standard tools as well as how to report on those exploits in order to help strengthen application security.
>
> I work as a software engineer with a primary focus on full-stack web development using the ASPNET C# tech stack. I have previous experience working with more modern front end frameworks such as React and various CSS frameworks.
